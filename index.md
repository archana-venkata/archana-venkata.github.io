## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [The University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/students/archana-vadakattu). I am working in the Department of Computing and Information Systems, specifically in the [AI and Autonomy Lab](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/agentlab#about). 

My research focusses on cognitive approaches to achieving transfer learning, and ultimately lifelong learning, in AI agent systems. More specifically, my Ph.D. topic is about leveraging the human cognitive ability to develop strategies in different contexts to make plausible default assumptions in unfamiliar environments. 

Previously, I have completed a Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Honours) with Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (Computer Science Major) at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) in 2018. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a computer scientist in industry for 2 years, where I developed an interest in cognitive agent research.

## Research Interests

- **Cognitive AI:** adaptive agents, human computer interaction
- **Machine Learning:** transfer learning, reinforcement learning

## News

- **[Mar. 2023]** Our paper about strategy extraction is accepted to the ALA 2023 workshop.
- **[Mar. 2023]** I will be attending the Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems 2023 conference in London, UK!
