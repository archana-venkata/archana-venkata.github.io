## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [The University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/students/archana-vadakattu). I am working in the Department of Computing and Information Systems in the [AI and Autonomy Lab](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/agentlab#about) under [Prof. Adrian R. Pearce](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14397-adrian-pearce) and [Dr. Michelle Blom](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/178724-michelle-blom). 

My research focuses on cognitive approaches to achieving transfer learning, and ultimately lifelong learning, in AI agent systems. More specifically, my PhD topic is about leveraging the human cognitive ability to develop strategies in different contexts. We envision that agents can utilise these strategies to make plausible default assumptions in unfamiliar environments. 

Previously, I completed a Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Honours) with a Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (Computer Science Major) at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) in 2018. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a computer scientist in industry for two years, where I developed an interest in cognitive agent research.

## Research Interests
